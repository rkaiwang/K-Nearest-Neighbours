# K-Nearest-Neighbours
This is a KNN model that takes in data from iris flowers and predicts which species of iris the flower belongs to. It uses the features sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width to predict the target variable species. The 3 different species are setosa, versicolor and virginica.
